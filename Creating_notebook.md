# Creating a Github/Jekyll Lab Notebook

Jekyll is a software designed for simple site generators for personal, project, or organization webpages. There are many jekyll themes out there available to "fork". When you fork a webpage or repository on github, you're making your own "branch" or copy of that repository. Forking allows you to manipulate that repository without affecting the original. Explore the following links for examples of webpages and general how-tos. Choose a theme you'd like to fork for your own webpage and see the following instructions on how to set up your page.

See below for examples:

See Maggie Schedl's protocol on forking our lab notebook:

How to fork my open lab notebook:  
1. Log into github or create a free account.
2. Open another browser window with this link: https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/.  
3. Select "Fork" in the upper right hand corner:  
![Notebook_homepage](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/images/create_fork.png?raw=true)
4. Github will ask you "Where should we fork EmmaStrand_Notebook?" Select your github profile.
5. Once forking is finished, Click "Settings" in your repository. Change your repository name to "yourgithubusername.github.io".
6. Your webpage should now be viewable at https://yourgithubusername.github.io. If not, wait a few minutes and refresh the page.

Customize your webpage:
1. Select the config.yml file.
2. Select the "Edit this file" function next to "Raw", "Blame", and "History".
![config_edit](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/images/edit_config.png?raw=true)
3. Edit "name: Emma L. Strand's Open Lab Notebook" to reflect the title of your site.
4. Edit "description" to reflect a short bio of your site.
5. "Avatar" is the link to your profile photo on the homepage of the site. My photo lives in the images folder and is called "URI.jpg".
6. Edit "footer-links" to reflect any outside media or contact information. Icons such as twitter, email, and github will appear at the bottom of the site with links to your personal accounts.
7. Edit "url" to reflect your webpage's link.
8. In the "Commit changes" box, write a short comment about what you edited. This is part of Git version control, if you need to return to a previous version then the comments made with each saved change will be helpful in tracking which version you'd like to return to.
9. Select the green "Commit changes" button.

The "images" folder houses all the images used in the markdown files, and on the webpage itself.
To upload an "avatar" photo:
1. In your Notebook homepage, select the images folder.
2. 


This format of webpage gives you the opportunity to tag your posts by categories, dates, projects, and tags. At the beginning of each post, you will have to include the following:
![post_tags](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/images/post_tags.png?raw=true)


There are two main ways to edit the content within your repository: either editing directly online at GitHub.com or locally on your computer.

To create a local repository:
1. Open the Terminal application your computer. Terminal is an interface to work in a command line using Unix shell and bash scripts. See the following for more information about working with Unix Shell and version control with Git: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/.
