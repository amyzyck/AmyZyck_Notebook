# Creating a Github/Jekyll Lab Notebook

Jekyll is a software designed for simple site generators for personal, project, or organization webpages. There are many jekyll themes out there available to "fork". When you fork a webpage or repository on github, you're making your own "branch" or copy of that repository. Forking allows you to manipulate that repository without affecting the original. Explore the following links for examples of webpages and general how-tos. Choose a theme you'd like to fork for your own webpage and see the following instructions on how to set up your page.

See below for examples:

How to fork my open lab notebook:  
1. Log into github or create a free account.
2. Open another browser window with this link: https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/.  
3. Select "Fork" in the upper right hand corner:  
![Notebook_homepage](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/images/create_fork.png?raw=true)
4. Github will ask you "Where should we fork EmmaStrand_Notebook?" Select your github profile.
5. Once forking is finished, Click "Settings" in your repository. Change your repository name to "yourgithubusername.github.io".
6. Your webpage should now be viewable at https://yourgithubusername.github.io. If not, wait a few minutes and refresh the page.

Customize your webpage:
1. Select the config.yml file.  
![config_edit]()


There are two main ways to edit the content within your repository: either editing directly online at GitHub.com or locally on your computer.

To create a local repository:
1. Open the Terminal application your computer. Terminal is an interface to work in a command line using Unix shell and bash scripts. See the following for more information about working with Unix Shell and version control with Git: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/.
