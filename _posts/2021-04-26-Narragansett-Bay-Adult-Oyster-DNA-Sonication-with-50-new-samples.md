### Sonication of oyster DNA samples for shearing to 150 bp 

DNA extraction was previously performed on 50 oysters collected from 5 sites in Narragansett Bay.

### Sonication

Samples were sonicated using the [Qsonica Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qsonica/).

All 50 samples were sonicated to ~150 basepairs. Sonication was completed across 4 different days:

- Apr. 21, 2021: 8 samples
- Apr. 23, 2021: 14 samples
- Apr. 24, 2021: 14 samples
- Apr. 26, 2021: 14 samples

##### April 21, 2021

|Sample|Aliquot (for 500ng DNA)|10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to 51 uL (1 extra uL for TapeStation)|
|---|---|---|
|NAR_8 (1.8)|34.25|16.75|
|NAR_9 (1.9)|23.15|27.85|
|GHP_6 (2.6)|30.67|20.33|
|BAR_2 (3.2)|41.32|9.68|
|BAR_8 (3.8)|31.85|19.15|
|KIC_4 (4.4)|35.46|15.54|
|KIC_8 (4.8)|24.27|26.73|
|MCD_5 (5.5)|14.53|36.47|

Samples were sonicated with:

- 32 minute time setting
- 15 seconds on 15 seconds off
- amplitude of 25%

*Samples were spun down every 2 minutes of the program (the timer pauses during the 15 second OFF period, so while 4 actual minutes pass only 2 minutes pass in the program).*

Samples were checked following the [D5000 Tape Station Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md).

Report can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o7dx6fSCYFBsTJEOve81VsMcHSw4WfiX/view?usp=sharing)

- Samples 1.9, 2.6, 3.2, 3.8, and 4.8 were sonicated for 6 more minutes and again checked on the [Tape Station](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2MSaQRbui3PQNW20IjMOQv5d_UzfV61/view?usp=sharing).

- On April 22, 2021, samples 2.6, 3.2, 3.8, and 4.8 were sonicated for 12 more minutes and checked on the [Tape Station](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDIN3RMCXRxDLl_jwd_Z8a7CclY0BusA/view?usp=sharing).
