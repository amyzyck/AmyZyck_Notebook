### DNA Extraction of Adult Oyster Tissue - Part 6

~10 wild adult oysters were collected from 5 populations in Narragansett Bay
  - Narrow River
  - Green Hill Pond
  - Barrington River
  - Kickemuit
  - Mary C. Donovan Marsh

Mantle and gill tissue were dissected from the oysters. Dissection protocol can be accessed [here](https://amyzyck.github.io/AmyZyck_Notebook/Narragansett-Bay-Adult-Oyster-Tissue-Dissections/).

#### DNA Extractions

Completed on February 3, 2021

__[Zymo Research Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-kits/products/quick-dna-miniprep-plus-kit) used for DNA extractions of adult oyster tissue__

  - BAR_1 M1
  - BAR_9 G1
  - KIC_5 M1
  - KIC_5 G1
  - MCD_10 M1
  - MCD_10 G1
- Pull Proteinase k out of upright -20 freezer in Puritz Zymo Reagents box and put on ice
- Pull out Type II DI water, 10X PBS solution, Blue solid tissue buffer, and Nuclease-free water
- In original sample tube, add 90 ul of Type II DI water and 10 ul of 10X PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution to create 1X PBS solution soak
  - Vortex and spin down in mini centrifuge
- Let soak for 5-10 minutes while preparing next set of tubes
- In 2 ml Homogenization Tubes with ceramic beads, add 190 ul of Blue Solid Tissue Buffer and 190 ul of Nuclease-free water
  - Vortex and spin down
- Sterilize forceps with 10% Bleach, Type II DI Water, and 70% EtOH
- Use forceps to transfer tissue piece from original tube with PBS solution to 2 ml Homogenization tube with ceramic beads at solid tissue buffer and nuclease-free water
  - Sterilize forceps before each sample
- Setup tissuelyser II
  - Make sure to balance both tube racks
- Homogenize tissue samples in tissuelyser II for 2 minutes at 30 Hz
  - *This will create a ton of bubbles in the sample tubes*
- Let the samples sit for about 3 minutes then spin down on tabletop centrifuge at 13000 rcf for 1 min to bring down bubbles
- Add 20 ul of Proteinase k to each sample
  - Vortex for 10 seconds then spin down on mini Centrifuge
- Put samples in thermomixer at 55 deg C at 1000 rpm for 30 minutes
  - Halfway thru, spin down samples on tabletop centrifuge at 13000 rcf for 1 min
- Make new set of labeled 1.5 ml tubes
- After 30 minute incubation, place all samples in tabletop centrifuge and spin at 13000 rcf for 2 minutes
- Transfer all supernatant (400 ul) to the newly labeled 1.5 ml tubes
- Make 1.5 ml tube of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 and place in thermomixer at 70 deg C
- Set up tubes for extraction - 1 yellow spin column inside a collection tube for each sample - label lid of spin column
- Get liquid waste beaker from sink near -80 freezers
- Add 2 parts volume (800 ul) of Genomic Binding buffer to each tube
 - Vortex for 5 seconds and spin down in mini centrifuge
- Add 800 ul of sample to their labeled yellow spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Put spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add remaining liquid (400 ul) from each sample to labeled yellow spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Transfer spin columns to new collection tubes and discard of old collection tubes
- Add 400 ul of DNA pre-wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge at 13000 rcf from 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Place spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add 700 ul of g-DNA wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Put spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add 200 ul of g-DNA wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Make final 1.5 ml tubes - label lid with sample id, elution #, and DNA; label side with initials, date of extraction, sample id, elution #, DNA, and C. virginica
  - Make 2 tubes for each sample - splitting the two elutions into two separate tubes
- Transfer spin columns to first set of labeled 1.5 ml tubes
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker and discard collection tubes
- Take warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 out of thermomixer
- Add 30 ul of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to each spin column by dripping directly over the filter without touching it
- Immediately place tubes in centrifuge with all the lids of the 1.5 ml tubes facing the same direction and centrifuge at MAX speed for 1 minute
  - *No incubation period for the first elution*
- Take tubes out - DO NOT pour off liquid, keep in tube
- Transfer spin columns to second set of labeled 1.5-ml tubes, add 100 ul of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to each spin column by dripping directly over filter without touching it
  - Put first set of 1.5-ml tubes with the first elution on ice
- Incubate for 10 minutes
- Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute
- Take out spin columns at discard
- Make labeled PCR strip tubes - 1 for each elution = 2 per sample
  - Add 1 ul of DNA and 4 ul of nuclease-free water to the respective PCR tube for agarose gel
  - 1 ul will be taken directly from 1.5-ml tube for Qubit

*28 ul remaining in all E1 1.5 ml tubes; 98 ul remaining in all E2 1.5 ml tubes*

__Qubit dsDNA BR assay__

The captured pools were quantified following [Qubit protocol for BR DNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)

|Sample|Avg ng/Î¼l|
|----|----|
|Std 1|152 RFU|
|Std 2|14698 RFU|
|NAR_9 M E1|168|
|NAR_9 M E2|21.8|
|GHP_3 G E1|153|
|GHP_3 G E2|16.2|
|GHP_7 M E1|132|
|GHP_7 M E2|8.53|
|GHP_7 G E1|178|
|GHP_7 G E2|15.5|
|BAR_1 M E1|139|
|BAR_1 M E2|11.0|
|BAR_9 G E1|204|
|BAR_9 G E2|23.9|
|KIC_5 M E1|172|
|KIC_5 M E2|19.1|
|KIC_5 G E1|201|
|KIC_5 G E2|39.8|
|MCD_10 M E1|43.5|
|MCD_10 M E2|2.93|
|MCD_10 G E1|95.9|
|MCD_10 G E2|2.31|

MCD_10 does not have a lot of DNA. Otherwise the other samples seem good.

__Agarose Gel Electrophoresis__

The DNA quality and size were assessed following [Agarose Gel Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-01/PPP-Lab-Gel-Protocol) for a small 1% gel.

- Only 1 ul of DNA for each sample were used
  - 4 ul of nuclease-free water added to bring volume up to 5 ul
- Did not use diluted gelgreen this time
- Used a different loading dye - Purple loading dye versus Tritrack

Not sure why the MCD_10 M E2 and MCD_10 G E2 samples are not showing up - there was very little DNA in both those samples. Aside from MCD_10, all the other samples look good! Will move forward with DNA extractions following this protocol.
