50 adult oyster DNA samples were received from [Dr. Rebecca Stevick](https://github.com/rjstevick).

### Qubit
Prior to sonication, DNA concentrations were calculated following the Qubit dsDNA broad range [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/).

Concentrations ranged from 12.8 uL - 528 uL.

### Sonication

Samples were sonicated using the [Qsonica Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qsonica/).

The remaining 42 samples were sonicated to ~150 basepairs. These remaining samples were broken up into 3 sets of 14 samples, sonicated on: Oct. 11, 2019; Oct. 16, 2019; Oct. 24, 2019.

|1.5|21.19|29.81|
|2.7|19.38|31.62|

|5.4|6.19|44.81|
|5.7|6.33|44.67|
|5.9|5.53|45.47|


Samples were sonicated with:

- 35 minute time setting
- 15 seconds on 15 seconds off
- amplitude of 25%

*Samples were spun down every 4 minutes.*

Samples were checked following the [D5000 Tape Station Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md).

Sample 4.1 was sonicated for an extra 2 minutes.
