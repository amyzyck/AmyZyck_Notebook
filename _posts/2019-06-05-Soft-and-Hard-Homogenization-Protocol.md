# Soft and Hard Homogenization Protocol
Goal: To extract DNA and RNA from coral fragments and to enrich for host in the first "soft homogenization" fraction and holobiont in the "hard homogenization" fraction.

Testing to see if "Soft homogenization" will include DNA and RNA from primarily the host for transcriptomics and DNA methylation analysis. "Hard homogenization" will include the DNA from the symbionts and microbiome for ITS2 and 16s amplification and Holobiont RNA.

### Protocol Preparation

**Reagents and supplies**
- RNAse Away
- RNA/DNA shield   
- RNAse-free water
- Proteinase K digestion buffer
- Proteinase K  
- Isopropanol  
- 10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 made with RNase-free water  
- 10% bleach
- Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction kit buffers: DNA/RNA lysis buffer, DNA/RNA Prep Buffer, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer, DNA Digestion buffer, and DNase I

**Equipment**  
- Rocking oven that can be set at 55 &deg;C
- Thermomixer
- Vortexer  
- Qiagen Tissue Lyser: [Handbook](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=65e7826c-4d50-4faf-8154-2fbc782c41a6&lang=en)
- Bead tubes: 2mL 0.5mm glass beads and tubes from [Fisher Scientific](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152)
- Designated RNAse free space  
- Tabletop and larger centrifuges for 1.5 mL capable of 12,000xg  
- Clippers

### Reagent Preparation

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) 20 mg Proteinase K with 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer or lyophilized (freeze-dried) 5 mg Proteinase K with 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Vortex to dissolve. Store at -20 &deg;C.

### Fragment Preparation

Sterilizing working area:
I. Rinse clippers with:
  1. 10% bleach solution  
  2. DI water  
  3. Isopropanol  
  4. RNAse free water

II. Spray gloves with RNAse away and rub hands together.

Take fragments one at a time out of the freezer and sterilize clippers in between every fragment. These steps are time sensitive to prevent the coral fragments and freezer from thawing. Do not rush, but be efficient.

Assign "extraction numbers" to each ID for ease of labeling. See below chart for an example:  

| Extraction # | Coral ID | Species     | Homogenization |
|--------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1            | 1123     | Montipora   | Soft           |
| 2            | 1123     | Montipora   | Hard           |
| 3            | 1769     | Montipora   | Soft           |
| 4            | 1769     | Montipora   | Hard           |
| 5            | 1056     | Pocillopora | Soft           |
| 6            | 1056     | Pocillopora | Hard           |
| 7            | 1607     | Pocillopora | Soft           |
| 8            | 1607     | Pocillopora | Hard           |

Clipping fragment:  
1. Label the lid of a bead tube with the coral fragment's sample ID number, and the side of the tube with the coral fragment ID and today's date.  
2. Add 1000 μl of RNA/DNA shield to the bead tube.
3. Remove desired fragment from -80 &deg;C freezer.  
4. Using sterilized clippers, clip off 1-2 small pieces and place into the bead tube. RNA/DNA shield needs to cover the fragments.

*Repeat above steps 1-5 for each fragment before moving on.*

### Soft and Hard Homogenization

5. Vortex for *Pocillopora* fragments for 1 minute and the *Montipora* fragments for 2 minutes. Leave the settings on and on max power. This is the "soft homogenization" step.  
6. After vortex time, check to see if the tissue is coming off of the skeleton and look for coloration change in shield liquid.  
7. Remove supernatant from the bead tube and place in a new 1.5 microcentrifuge tube labeled on the side with the extraction ID number, coral fragment's sample ID number, "soft", and today's date. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the extraction number. This supernatant will become the sample for "soft homogenization". The remaining chunks of fragment will become the sample for "hard homogenization".  
8. Add 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield to the bead tube with the coral fragment pieces. RNA/DNA shield needs to cover the fragment pieces.   
9. Place the beads tubes with the coral fragment pieces in the Qiagen Tissue Lyser Adapter Set 2 x 24.  
10. Operate the Tissue Lyser for 30 seconds at 20 Hz.       
11. Remove the supernatant and put in a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube labeled on the side with the extraction ID number, coral fragment's sample ID number, "hard", and today's date. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the extraction ID number.  
12. Add 300 μl of sample, 30 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 15 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.  
> At this point, each coral fragment should have 2 tubes to move forward to extractions with: one for soft homogenization and one for hard homogenization.  
For 4 coral fragments: 4 bead tubes with coral fragment pieces, 8 tubes with leftover homogenate sample (4 soft, 4 hard), and 8 tubes with homogenate, Proteinase K digestion buffer, and Proteinase K (4 soft, 4 hard).   

13. Vortex and spin down all tubes.   
14. Place bead tubes and leftover homogenate tubes in -80 &deg;C freezer.
