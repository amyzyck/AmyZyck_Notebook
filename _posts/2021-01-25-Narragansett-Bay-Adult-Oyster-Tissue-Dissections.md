### Oyster Tissue Dissections

Tissue dissections of adult oysters were first done with oysters purchased from [Fearless Fish Market](https://madmolecularman.github.io/JMG_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/Buying_Storing_Oysters/). All dissections were completed with [Jacob Green](https://github.com/madmolecularman). Completed on September 30, 2020.

In October 2020, wild adult oysters were collected from 5 populations in Narragansett Bay.
  - Narrow River
  - Green Hill Pond
  - Barrington River
  - Kickemuit
  - Mary C. Donovan Marsh

Oysters were put on ice and kept in the environmental room until dissections were performed. Dissections were completed in October 2020.

#### Equipment

- Sterilization
  - 70% EtOH squirt bottle and waste bin
  - DI water squirt bottle and waste bin
  - 10% bleach squirt bottle and waste bin
- Dissection
  - Cut resistant gloves
  - Shucking knife
  - Cutting board
  - Small forceps
  - Dissection scissors
  - Razor blades
  - weigh boats (aluminum or plastic)
  - calipers
  - Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) in canister
  - 1.5 ml tubes labeled with sample id and tissue type and # on lid; initials, date, sample id, tissue type and #, and Crassostrea virginica on side
- Sterilize cutting board, shucking knife, forceps, scissors, and razor blade with 10% bleach, 70% EtOH, and DI water
- Fill up canister with liquid Nitrogen - make sure lid is secured tightly
  - Do this before each oyster
- Take oyster off ice and wipe off any animals or debris attached to shell
- Image next to ruler (for potential image analysis later)
- With calipers, measure oyster shell length and width (mm)
- Tare weigh boat on scale, then weigh total oyster mass (g)
- Record oyster mass, shell length and width in data sheet
- Wear cut resistant gloves while shucking
- On cutting board, insert shucking knife near hinge of shell
  - Gently but firmly separate the two valves of shell (may take some time depending on oyster)
  - Once the valves separate, run the knife around shell to cut adductor muscles (top right of oyster)
- Locate the mantle and gills in the oyster
- For each tissue type, using the forceps and scissors to cut about a quarter-sized piece of tissue and transfer to the cutting board
- On the cutting board, further cut the piece of tissue into SMALL pieces of tissue (smaller than a pea)
- Tare the 1.5 ml tube and then transfer a piece of tissue to the appropriate tube
- Weigh the tissue in the tube on the scale
  - The tissue should be between 10 and 20 mg
  - Record all tissue masses in data sheet 
- Gently put tube with tissue piece in LN2 canister for preservation  
- Repeat this 6 times for each tissue type for each oyster
  - 6 mantle pieces
  - 6 gill pieces
- Remove all remaining tissue from oyster using a razor blade and put in a 50 ml conical tube and put in LN2 canister
- Dry oyster shells and weigh on scale (g) after taring weigh boat
- Put all tissue samples in -80 freezer
- Re-sanitize all dissecting equipment
- Repeat the steps above for all oysters
