# Soft and Hard Homogenization DNA/RNA Extractions #73-82

**20190722 E.S.**
DNA/RNA Extractions from *Montipora capitata* and *Pocillopora acuta* adult coral fragments from Holobiont Integration Hawaii 2018 project.  

Soft and Hard homogenization, and DNA/RNA Extractions followed this [protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-06-05-Soft-and-Hard-Homogenization-Protocol.md). General Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction protocol found [here](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md).  
Coral fragments were randomly chosen from different timepoint bags.

50 μl of 100% ethanol added to extraction #s: 79, 73, 75, 82, and 81 in final elution step accidentally. Final volume of the above 5 DNA extractions is 150 μl. Residual ethanol will prevent full hydration and elution of nucleic acids, and too much ethanol will cause the sample to not sink into a well in the DNA gel. These five samples might be too diluted to quantify DNA.
