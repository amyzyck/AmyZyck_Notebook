### Mytilus Tissue Tri-Reagent RNA Extraction

Extracting RNA from preserved *Mytilus spp* tissue using a Tri-Reagent/Direct-zol RNA Isolation Protocol written by [Johanna Harvey](https://github.com/JAHarvey).

[Zymo Research Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/direct-zol_rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)

This protocol was previously tested on live *M. edulis* tissue with [Maggie Schedl](https://github.com/meschedl). That work can be accessed [here](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-12/Mytilus-Live-RNA-Extraction).

#### Tri-Reagent RNA Extraction

Completed on March 28, 2019

- *Wear a lab coat and complete all steps that involve the Tri-Reagent and 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane in the hood*
- Aliquot 1000 uL of Tri-Reagent (stored in 4 degree fridge) per sample (8 samples total) into two 5mL tubes and keep in ice bucket
- Aliquot 100µl of 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane (stored in the acid cabinet) per sample (8 samples total) into a 1.5mL tube and keep in ice bucket
- Clean forceps with DI Water, 70% EtOH, RNaseZap, and Nuclease-free water for each tissue sample
- Pull out pea-sized chunk of tissue from tube using the cleaned forceps, rinse in nuclease-free water and transfer to a bead tube
- Immediately add 1000 ul of Tri-Reagent to the bead tube containing the tissue piece
  - Do this in the hood
- Homogenize tissue with Beadbug until tissue is fully homogenized
  - Time will vary between samples

|Sample|Homogenization Time|
|----|----|
|4590|120 sec|
|4596|80 sec|
|4598|80 sec|
|4599|40 sec|
|4593|160 sec|
|4597|160 sec|
|4611|40 sec|
|4512|120 sec|

- All liquid was aspirated into a new 1.5 mL tube (don't put on ice)
  - Ended up with ~900 ul per tube
- Add 90 ul of cold 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane to each sample tube and invert tubes repeatedly for 20 seconds (keep off ice)
- Incubate tubes at room temperature for 15 minutes
- During the incubation period, turn on centrifuge, set for 2 deg C and let spin for ~8 minutes to cool down
- After incubation, centrifuge samples at highest speed for 30 minutes
- Carefully remove tubes from centrifuge
- With a p200 ul pipette, carefully remove ~500ul of the clear supernatant (upper layer) and transfer to new 1.5 mL tube
- Put tubes containing the remaining organic phase in -80 for potential DNA extraction later
- Add equal volume (~500 ul) of 100% EtOH to the new sample tubes and invert to mix
- Transfer 500 ul of liquid into spin column from [Direct-zol kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/direct-zol_rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)
- Centrifuge at 16000 rcf for 30 seconds at room temperature (21-22 deg C on centrifuge)
- Transfer column to new collection tube, dump out flow through and add the other 500 ul of sample repeating the step above
- *After each centrifuge spin, samples are placed in new collection tubes*
- Add 400 ul of RNA Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 16000 rcf for 30 seconds
- Create DNase I treatment:
  - 75 ul of DNA Digestion Buffer x # of samples
  - 5 ul of DNase I x # of samples
- Add 80 ul of DNase I treatment mastermix directly to the filter of the spin column
- Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes
  - *DO NOT centrifuge after this step*
- Begin warming nuclease-free water in the large incubator to 70 deg C
- Add 400 ul of RNA Pre-wash buffer to each spin column and centrifuge at 16000 rcf for 30 seconds
- Again, add 400 ul of RNA Pre-wash buffer to each spin column and centrifuge at 16000 rcf for 30 seconds
- Add 700 ul of RNA Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 16000 rcf for 2 minutes
- Transfer spin columns to new 1.5 ml tubes (final tubes)
- Add 50 ul of warmed nuclease-free water directly to filter of spin column
- Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
- After incubation, centrifuge at 16000 rcf for 30 seconds
- Again, add 50 ul of warmed nuclease-free water directly to filter of spin column
- Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
- After incubation, centrifuge at 16000 rcf for 30 seconds
- Aliquot 5 ul of RNA for Qubit and TapeStation analysis in strip tubes
- Store the remaining RNA in the labeled 1.5-ml tubes in the -80 freezer

__Qubit BR RNA assay__

Extracted RNA was quantified on the Qubit following the [BR RNA assay protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-02/Qubit-Protocol)

*Notes from the RNA extraction process*

- Sample 4405 and 4452 had about 700 ul of Tri-Reagent after re-aliquoting into 1.5 ml tubes, so I added 70 ul of the 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane
- All the other samples had ~900 ul of Tri-Reagent, so I added 90 ul of the 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane
- When removing the RNA phase from the remaining organic phase, sample 4405 only had ~450 ul to pull off
  - Sample 4452 only had 400 ul to pull off
  - All remaining samples had 500 ul to pull off

- Sample Primel 9 had its tissue piece stuck to the lid of the tube, so it may not have been preserved in RNase
- All samples had about 950 ul of Tri-Reagent after re-aliquoting into 1.5 ml tubes, so I added 95 ul of the 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane
