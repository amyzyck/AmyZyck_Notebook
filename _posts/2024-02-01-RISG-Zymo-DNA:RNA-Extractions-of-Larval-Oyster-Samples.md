# Zymo DNA/RNA Extractions of Larval Oyster Samples

Using [Zymo *Quick*-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)

Extracting DNA and RNA from larval oyster samples from multi-stressor exposure experiment. 

Larvae were collected onto Pluri filters, preserved with liquid nitrogen, stored in Whirlpaks and held in a -80 freezer until processing. 

This is the general protocol I followed for DNA/RNA Extractions. I typically processed 10-12 samples at a time. 

**Time to Completion: 8-10 hours (includes QC)**

### Homogenization 
- In 50 mL falcon tubes, add 1000 μL of DNA/RNA Shield (can be prepped the night before)
- Turn on Incubator Genie and set to 55 degrees C, rocking speed 35
- Pull Proteinase K out of -20 freezer to warm to room temperature 
- Sterilize scalpel blade with 100% EtOH, Type II DI Water, RNAseZap, and RNAse-free Water
    - Repeat the sterilization between each sample
- Take samples out of -80 freezer one at a time 
- Place filter on open falcon tube, and cut a cross section through the filter then cut the perimeter of the filter 
    - Make sure all pieces of the filter fall into the falcon tube and are submerged in DNA/RNA Shield
- Add 100 μL of PK Digestion Buffer to each tube
- Add 50 μL Proteinase K to each tube and vortex to mix 
- Incubate tubes in Incubator Genie at 55 degrees C, rocking speed 35 for 2.5 hours 
    - Vortex the tubes every 30 minutes
- During incubation period: 
    - Prep and label all tubes for extraction protocol (for each tube type, multiply by number of samples being processed)
        - 1.5 mL tubes for digested sample
        - 5  mL tubes for intermediate DNA steps
        - 5 mL tubes for intermediate RNA steps
        - Yellow spin-column and collection tubes for DNA purification 
        - Green or white spin-column and collection tubes for RNA purification (spin-column color will depend on kit)
        - 1.5 mL tubes for final DNA sample
        - 1.5 mL tubes for final RNA sample 
    - Prep 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 and RNAse-free Water for thermomixer 
        - For each, 100 μL x # of samples (plus error) in 1.5 mL tubes 
        - Put in thermomixer set to 70 degrees C 
    - Make DNAse reaction mix: 
        - DNA Digestion Buffer: 75 μL x # of samples
        - DNAse I: 5 μL x # of samples 
- After incubation, spin down falcon tubes in large centrifuge at max speed for 2 minutes
- Transfer all liquid, minus filter pieces, to 1.5 mL tubes
- Centrifuge tubes in tabletop centrifuge at max speed for 2 minutes 
- Being careful not to disturb debris pellet, transfer all liquid to 5 mL tube for DNA 
    - Save debris pellet in labeled 1.5 mL tube and store in -20 freezer (can check for incomplete digestion later on if necessary)
- Add equal volume (1000 μL) of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each 5 mL tube for DNA 
    - Finger flick to mix
- Transfer 700 μL of supernatant to yellow spin column 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
- Transfer flow-through to 5 mL tube for RNA 
- Repeat until all supernatant is filtered (3 times total)
- *Pull Biotium dsDNA and RNA kits out of fridge/freezer and put in drawer (light sensitive) to warm to room temperature*

#### DNA Purification 
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to yellow spin-column 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds 
    - discard flow-through
- Add 700 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds 
    - discard flow-through
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for **2 minutes** 
    - discard flow-through
- Transfer spin-column to final 1.5 mL tube
- Carefully drip 50 μL of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 directly onto filter 
- Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
    - KEEP FLOW-THROUGH
- Again, carefully drip 50 μL of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 directly onto filter 
- Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
- **Should have 100 μL of DNA**

    - Discard flow-through
- Repeat until all supernatant is filtered (6 times total)
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to white spin-column
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
    - discard flow-through
- Add 80 μL of DNAse reaction mix to each column (I add directly onto filter)
- Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to white spin-column 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds 
    - discard flow-through
