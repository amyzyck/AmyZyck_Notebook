### Practice DNA Extractions on Oysters from Fish Market

Before starting DNA extractions of the tissue from oysters collected at sites in Narragansett Bay, I wanted to practice the extraction protocol using the tissue of oysters purchased from the [Fearless Fish Market](https://madmolecularman.github.io/JMG_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/Buying_Storing_Oysters/). Mantle and gill tissues were dissected from these oysters in September 2020 by [Jacob Green](https://github.com/madmolecularman). Tissue dissection protocol can be accessed [here](https://amyzyck.github.io/AmyZyck_Notebook/Narragansett-Bay-Adult-Oyster-Tissue-Dissections/).

- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Put spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add remaining liquid (200 ul) from each sample to labeled yellow spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Transfer spin columns to new collection tubes and discard of old collection tubes
- Add 400 ul of DNA pre-wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge at 13000 rcf from 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Place spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add 700 ul of g-DNA wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Put spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add 200 ul of g-DNA wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Make final 1.5 ml tubes - label lide with sample id and DNA; label side with initials, date of extraction, sample id, DNA, and C. virginica
- Transfer spin columns to labeled 1.5 ml tubes
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker and discard collection tubes
- Take warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 out of thermomixer
- Add 50 ul of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to each spin column by dripping directly over the filter without touching it
- Incubate for 5 minutes
- Place tubes in centrifuge with all the lids of the 1.5 ml tubes facing the same direction and centrifuge at MAX speed for 1 minute
- Take tubes out - DO NOT pour off liquid, keep in tube
- Add an additional 50 ul of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to each spin column by dripping directly over filter without touching it
  - *100 ul of DNA total*
- Incubate for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute
- Take out spin columns at discard
- Set up PCR strip tubes, labeling with the appropriate sample ids
- Aliquot 8 ul of each sample to their respective PCR strip tube
  - 5 ul for agarose gel
  - 1 ul for Qubit
  - 1 ul for TapeStation (if needed)
  - 1 ul for error

*92 ul remaining in 1.5 ml sample tubes*

__Qubit dsDNA BR assay__

The captured pools were quantified following [Qubit protocol for BR DNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)

- 199 ul x 5.2 samples = 1034.8 ul of Buffer
- 1 ul x 5.2 samples = 5.2 ul of reagent

|Sample|Avg ng/μl|
|----|----|
|Std 1|177 RFU|
|Std 2|17776 RFU|
|AA001|40.4|
|AA004|66.5|
|AA008|51|

__Agarose Gel Electrophoresis__

The DNA quality and size were assessed following [Agarose Gel Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-01/PPP-Lab-Gel-Protocol) for a small 1% gel.

Gel was run with Kevin Wong. His samples are the top row.

The samples look very streaky. Likely due to gel artifacts Will do a 1X Beadclean and then run samples on gel again.

- Again, add 200 ul of 80% EtOH while still on magnet
  - Remove all of clear supernatant

The gel does not look any different. I will look at the samples on the TapeStation.

The DNA looks pretty good, some smaller fragments around 1500 bp, but the majority is still larger fragments. I'm not sure why the gel looked bad. For future gels, I will use less DNA (2 ul instead of 5 ul) and used diluted gelgreen.
