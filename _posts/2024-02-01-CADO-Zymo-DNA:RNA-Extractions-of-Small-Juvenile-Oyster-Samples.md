## Zymo DNA/RNA Extractions of Juvenile Oyster (< 4 mm) Samples

Extracting DNA and RNA from juvenile oyster samples from a multi-stressor exposure experiment. 

Juveniles were collected individually in 1.5 mL tubes, preserved with liquid nitrogen, and held in a -80 freezer until processing. 

This is the general protocol followed for DNA/RNA Extractions. I typically processed 12 samples at a time. 

Time to Completion: 6-8 hours (includes QC)

### Homogenization
- Turn on Incubator Genie and set to 55 degrees C, rocking speed 35
- Pull Proteinase K out of -20 freezer to warm to room temperature 
- In 1.5 mL tubes, add 300 μL of DNA/RNA Shield 
- Pull samples out of -80 freezer and put on ice 
- Sterilize forceps with 100% EtOH, Type II DI Water, RNAse Zap, and RNAse-free Water
    - Sterilize forceps between each sample
- Using forceps, transfer juvenile to 1.5 mL tube with DNA/RNA Shield 
- Add 30 μL PK Digestion Buffer to each tube
- Add 15 μL Proteinase K 
- Vortex for 30 seconds and spin down 
- Incubate in Incubator Genie at 55 degrees C for 2 hours
    - Every 30 minutes, vortex samples for 30 seconds and spin down 
- During incubation period 
    - Prep and label all tubes for extraction protocol (for each tube type, multiply by number of samples being processed)
        - 1.5 mL tubes for intermediate DNA
        - 1.5 mL tubes for intermediate RNA 
        - Yellow spin-column and collection tubes for DNA purification 
        - Green or white spin-column and collection tubes for RNA purification (spin-column color will depend on kit)
        - 1.5 mL tubes for final DNA sample
        - 1.5 mL tubes for final RNA sample
    - Prep 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 and RNAse-free Water for thermomixer 
        - For each, 50 μL x # of samples (plus error) in 1.5 mL tubes 
        - Put in thermomixer set to 70 degrees C 
    - Make DNAse reaction mix: 
        - DNA Digestion Buffer: 75 μL x # of samples
        - DNAse I: 5 μL x # of samples 
- After incubation, spin down tubes at max speed for 2 minutes in tabletop centrifuge 
- Without disturbing the debris pellet, gently transfer all supernatant (~350 μL) to new 1.5 mL tube for DNA 
    - Save debris pellet and store in -20 freezer (can check for incomplete digestion later on if necessary)
- Add equal volume (300 μL) of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube
    - Finger flick to mix
- Transfer all supernatant (~600 μL) to yellow spin-column 
- Centrigue at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds 
- Transfer flow-through to new 1.5 mL tube for RNA 

#### DNA Purification 
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to yellow spin-column 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds 
    - discard flow-through
- Add 700 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds 
    - discard flow-through
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for **2 minutes** 
    - discard flow-through
- Transfer spin-column to final 1.5 mL tube
- Carefully drip 50 μL of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 directly onto filter 
- Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
- Pipette the 50 μL out of the 1.5 mL tube and  drip directly onto the filter again  
- Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
- **Should have 50 μL of DNA**

#### RNA Purification
- Add equal volume (600 μL) 100% EtOH to each 1.5 mL tube for RNA 
- Transfer 600 μL of supernatant to white spin-column 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
    - Discard flow-through
- Repeat until all supernatant is filtered (2 times total)
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to white spin-column
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
    - discard flow-through
- Add 80 μL of DNAse reaction mix to each column (I add directly onto filter)
- Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to white spin-column 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds 
    - discard flow-through
- Add 700 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds 
    - discard flow-through
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer 
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for **2 minutes** 
    - discard flow-through
- Transfer spin-column to final 1.5 mL tube
- Carefully drip 50 μL of warmed RNAse-free Water directly onto filter 
- Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
- Pipette the 50 μL out of the 1.5 mL tube and  drip directly onto the filter again  
- Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
- **Should have 50 μL of RNA**
