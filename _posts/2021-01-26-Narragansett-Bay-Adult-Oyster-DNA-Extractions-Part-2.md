### DNA Extraction of Adult Oyster Tissue - Part 2

~10 wild adult oysters were collected from 5 populations in Narragansett Bay
  - Narrow River
  - Green Hill Pond
  - Barrington River
  - Kickemuit
  - Mary C. Donovan Marsh

Mantle and gill tissue were dissected from the oysters. Dissection protocol can be accessed [here](https://amyzyck.github.io/AmyZyck_Notebook/Narragansett-Bay-Adult-Oyster-Tissue-Dissections/).

#### DNA Extractions

Completed on January 20, 2021

__[Zymo Research Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-kits/products/quick-dna-miniprep-plus-kit) used for DNA extractions of adult oyster tissue__

- Pull samples out of -80 freezer and put on ice
  - NAR_4
  - GHP_2
  - KIC_2
  - MCD_1
  - MCD_4
- Pull Proteinase k out of upright -20 freezer in Puritz Zymo Reagents box and put on ice
- Pull out Blue Solid Tissue Buffer from Zymo Research Quick DNA Miniprep kit
- First, I'm going to cut the tissue pieces into smaller pieces
  - Make new labeled 1.5-ml tubes
  - Lay out piece of aluminum foil
  - Sterilize foil, razor blade, and forceps with 70% EtOH and Type II DI water
  - Using forceps, take tissue piece out and lay on foil
  - Use razor blade to cut small piece of tissue
  - Transfer small tissue piece to new labeled 1.5-ml tube and return other tissue piece back to original tube
  - Sterilize foil, razor blade, and forceps before each new sample

- In each tube with the small tissue piece, add 95 ul of nuclease-free water, 95 ul of solid tissue buffer, and 10 ul of proteinase k
  - Vortex for 10 seconds and spin down on mini centrifuge
- Place tubes in thermomixer at 55 deg C shaking at 1200 rpm
  - Check tissue after 45 minutes
  - Added 5 more minutes
- After incubation, place all samples in the tabletop centrifuge and spin at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Make new set of labeled 1.5 ml tubes
- Pipette all supernatant (200 ul) to each new tube
- Make 1.5 ml tube of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 and place in thermomixer at 70 deg C
- Set up tubes for extraction - 1 yellow spin column inside a collection tube for each sample - label lid of spin column
- Get liquid waste beaker from sink near -80 freezers
- Add 2 parts volume (400 ul) of Genomic Binding buffer to each tube
 - Vortex for 5 seconds and spin down in mini centrifuge
- Add 400 ul of sample to their labeled yellow spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Put spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add remaining liquid (200 ul) from each sample to labeled yellow spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Transfer spin columns to new collection tubes and discard of old collection tubes
- Add 400 ul of DNA pre-wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge at 13000 rcf from 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Place spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add 700 ul of g-DNA wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Put spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add 200 ul of g-DNA wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Make final 1.5 ml tubes - label lide with sample id and DNA; label side with initials, date of extraction, sample id, DNA, and C. virginica
- Transfer spin columns to labeled 1.5 ml tubes
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker and discard collection tubes
- Take warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 out of thermomixer
- Add 50 ul of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to each spin column by dripping directly over the filter without touching it
- Incubate for 5 minutes
- Place tubes in centrifuge with all the lids of the 1.5 ml tubes facing the same direction and centrifuge at MAX speed for 1 minute
- Take tubes out - DO NOT pour off liquid, keep in tube
- Add an additional 50 ul of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to each spin column by dripping directly over filter without touching it
- Incubate for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute
- Take out spin columns at discard
- Aliquot 2 ul of each sample to their respective PCR strip tube for agarose gel
  - 1 ul will be taken directly from 1.5 ml tube for Qubit 

*97 ul remaining in 1.5 ml sample tubes*

__Qubit dsDNA BR assay__

The captured pools were quantified following [Qubit protocol for BR DNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)

- 199 ul x 7.2 samples = 1432.8 ul of Buffer
- 1 ul x 7.2 samples = 7.2 ul of reagent

|Sample|Avg ng/Î¼l|
|----|----|
|Std 1|175 RFU|
|Std 2|16908 RFU|
|NAR_4|19.9|
|GHP_2|33.6|
|KIC_2|17.6|
|MCD_1|2.48|
|MCD_4|5.79|

__Agarose Gel Electrophoresis__

The DNA quality and size were assessed following [Agarose Gel Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-01/PPP-Lab-Gel-Protocol) for a small 1% gel.

- Only 2 ul of DNA for each sample were used
- Used a diluted gelgreen made by [Maggie Schedl](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/)

This gel looks better. The two MCD samples have very little DNA, so I will likely re-do the extraction using the full tissue pieces for these two. I think I'll continue moving forward with the extractions using full tissue pieces.

Plan for next time:

- Try extraction on gill sample
- Do a PCB soak of the tissue before solubilization
- During solubilization in thermomixer, use slower rpm speed
- For centrifugation after solubilization, spin for 2 minutes at 13000 rcf
- During elution with 10 mM Tris HCl, separate the two elutions into two tubes
  - Smaller DNA fragments will elute first
