20190716 E. Strand

Testing the soft and hard homogenization protocol on extra molecular samples from the December recovery time period of the Holobiont Integration project. 2 *M. capitata* and 2 *P. acuta* fragments were randomly chosen from ATAC treatment 20181215. These four fragments were used on 20190715 and 20190716.

Changes for round 4:  
- No heat to lyse step because the heating might be contributing to the RNA degradation  
- just 1 fragment clipping because the RNA DNA shield might be overloaded with more than one clipping

500 µl of DNA RNA shield accidentally added to the soft homogenization tubes. The supernatant taken from the soft homogenization step instead of adding the shield to the tube with the coral fragment clippings.

Extraction steps: start 10:00 end 12:06. 8 samples takes about two hours.  

1056 soft DNA final tube lost some liquid.

DNAse I Master Mix Calculations:  
- 75 µl x 8 samples = 600 µl buffer  
- 5 µl DNase I x 8 samples = 40 µl DNase I enzyme

Master Mix Calculations:  
- 8 samples + 2 standards + 0.2% error = 10.2 µl reagent  
- 199 * 10.2 = 2,029.8 µl buffer
