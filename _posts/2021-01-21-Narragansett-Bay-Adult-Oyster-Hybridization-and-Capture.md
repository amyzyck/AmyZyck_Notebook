#### Pool Adult DNA library samples into 5 capture pools

Completed on December 10, 2019

Samples were assigned to a specific capture pool prior to DNA library prep. Each sample in a capture pool has a unique index primer pair and adapter combo. This will allow us to differentiate the samples following sequencing.
- Pool 200 ng of each DNA library
