50 adult oyster DNA samples were received from [Dr. Rebecca Stevick](https://github.com/rjstevick).

### Qubit
Prior to sonication, DNA concentrations were calculated following the Qubit dsDNA broad range [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/).

Concentrations ranged from 12.8 uL - 528 uL.

### Sonication

Samples were sonicated using the [Qsonica Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qsonica/).

8 random samples were sonicated to ~150 basepairs on September 26 and September 30, 2019.

|Sample|Aliquot (for 500ng DNA)|Buffer AE to 51 uL (1 extra uL for TapeStation)|
|---|---|---|
|1.2|11.42|39.58|
|1.6|17.01|33.99|
|2.6|15.72|35.28|
|3.9|2.58|48.42|
|4.4|0.95|50.05|
|4.7|1.45|49.55|
|5.6|4.20|46.80|
|5.8|3.03|47.97|

Samples were first sonicated on September 26th with:

- 27 minute time setting
- 15 seconds on 15 seconds off
- amplitude of 25%

*Samples were spun down every 3-6 minutes.*

Samples were checked following the [D5000 Tape Station Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md).

All samples needed additional shearing.

Samples were then sonicated again on September 30th with:

- 18 minute time setting
- 15 seconds on 15 seconds off
- amplitude of 25%

*Samples were spun down every 3-6 minutes.*

Samples were again checked on the Tape Station.
##### All samples were around 150 basepairs.
