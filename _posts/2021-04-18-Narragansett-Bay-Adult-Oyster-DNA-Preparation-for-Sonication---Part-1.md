### 1X Bead clean to concentrate DNA into smaller volume before sonication

Completed April 14, 2021

Before sonicating the DNA, a few samples need to have the DNA concentrated into a smaller volume. This is necessary because some samples had too little DNA to achieve 500 ng of DNA in 51 ul (volume needed for sonication).

|Sample|Description|Volume for 500 ng (ul)|Volume of Beads (ul)|
|----|----|----|----|
|NAR_3|Second extraction E2|95.11|95.11|
|NAR_5|Second extraction E2|72.71|72.71 (*accidentally used 95.11 ul*)|
|NAR_6|First extraction E2|76.53|76.53|
|NAR_7|Second extraction E2|95.11|95.11|
|NAR_8|First extraction E2|42.2|42.2|
|GHP_1|First extraction E2|72.31|72.31|
|GHP_2|Second extraction E2|92.43|92.43|
|GHP_3|First extraction E2|74.36|74.36|

- _Made fresh 80% EtOH_
- _Took KAPA Pure Beads out of fridge beforehand to warm to room temp for about 30 minutes_
- Vortex and spin down DNA samples
- For sample MCD_10, combine MCD_10 M E2 and MCD_10 G E2 into new 1.5 mL tube
- In new 1.5 mL tubes, add appropriate volume of sample (see column 3 in table above)
- Add appropriate volume of KAPA Pure Beads (see column 4 in table above) to each sample and pipette up and down 10 times to mix (_avoid bubbles_)
- Place tubes on shaker at room temp for 15 minutes - shaker set to 200 rpm's
- After 15 minute incubation, place tubes on magnet plate and remove supernatant from tubes when it was fully clear not disturbing the beads
  - Dispose of liquid in liquid waste beaker
- Add 200 μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Remove supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads
- Add 200 μl of 80% EtOH to each tube while still the magnet not disturbing the beads
- Remove ALL the supernatant from each tube on the magnet plate without disturbing the beads. Extra EtOH blobs were removed with p20 pipette tips
- Resuspend beads in 30 μl of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 and incubate tubes at room temp for 5 minutes
  - *Did not put on shaker this time*
- Place tubes on magnet plate and transfer supernatant when clear to new labeled 1.5 mL tubes
- 1 ul of each sample used for Qubit

*29 ul remaining in each sample*

#### Qubit dsDNA BR assay

- Followed [Qubit protocol for BR DNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)

|Sample|Avg ng/μl|
|----|----|
|Std 1|174 RFU|
|Std 2|18599 RFU|
|NAR_3|9.02|
|NAR_5|11.2|
|NAR_6|11.0|
|NAR_7|10.2|
|NAR_8|6.12|
|GHP_1|7.98|
|GHP_2|3.88|
|GHP_3|6.48|

A lot of DNA was lost during the bead clean, so all of these samples have less than 500 ng total. Thankfully I have replicate extracted DNA for all these samples, so I can use those to get 500 ng of DNA and move onto sonication.
