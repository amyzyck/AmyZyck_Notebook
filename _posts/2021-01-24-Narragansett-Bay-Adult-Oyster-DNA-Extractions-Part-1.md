### DNA Extraction of Adult Oyster Tissue - Part 1

~10 wild adult oysters were collected from 5 populations in Narragansett Bay
  - Narrow River
  - Green Hill Pond
  - Barrington River
  - Kickemuit
  - Mary C. Donovan Marsh

Mantle and gill tissue were dissected from the oysters. Dissection protocol can be accessed [here](https://amyzyck.github.io/AmyZyck_Notebook/Narragansett-Bay-Adult-Oyster-Tissue-Dissections/).

#### DNA Extractions

Completed on January 18, 2021

__[Zymo Research Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-kits/products/quick-dna-miniprep-plus-kit) used for DNA extractions of adult oyster tissue__

- Pull samples out of -80 freezer and put on ice
  - NAR_7 M2
  - BAR_5 M2
  - BAR_7 M2
  - GHP_8 M2
  - KIC_6 M1
- Pull Proteinase k out of upright -20 freezer in Puritz Zymo Reagents box and put on ice
- Pull out Blue Solid Tissue Buffer from Zymo Research Quick DNA Miniprep kit
- To each original tube with the tissue piece, add 95 ul of nuclease-free water, 95 ul of solid tissue buffer, and 10 ul of Proteinase k
  - Vortex for 10 seconds and spin down on mini centrifuge
- Place tubes in thermomixer at 55 deg C shaking at 1200 rpm
  - Check tissue after 30 minutes
    - The liquid was pretty cloudy, so I added another 15 minutes and then another 30 minutes
  - After 1 hour and 15 minutes, the liquid still looked cloudy so I decided to move forward with the dissection protocol

- After incubation, place all samples in the tabletop centrifuge and spin at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Make new set of labeled 1.5 ml tubes
- Pipette all supernatant (200 ul) to each new tube
- Make 1.5 ml tube of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 and place in thermomixer at 70 deg C
- Set up tubes for extraction - 1 yellow spin column inside a collection tube for each sample - label lid of spin column
- Get liquid waste beaker from sink near -80 freezers
- Add 2 parts volume (400 ul) of Genomic Binding buffer to each tube
 - Vortex for 5 seconds and spin down in mini centrifuge
- Add 400 ul of sample to their labeled yellow spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Put spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add remaining liquid (200 ul) from each sample to labeled yellow spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Transfer spin columns to new collection tubes and discard of old collection tubes
- Add 400 ul of DNA pre-wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge at 13000 rcf from 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Place spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add 700 ul of g-DNA wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker
- Put spin columns in same collection tubes
- Add 200 ul of g-DNA wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 13000 rcf for 1 minute
- Make final 1.5 ml tubes - label lide with sample id and DNA; label side with initials, date of extraction, sample id, DNA, and C. virginica
- Transfer spin columns to labeled 1.5 ml tubes
- Pour off flow through in liquid waste beaker and discard collection tubes
- Take warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 out of thermomixer
- Add 50 ul of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to each spin column by dripping directly over the filter without touching it
  - *Added too much Tris to KIC_6, so I'll add ~25 ul of Tris during the second elution for this sample*
- Incubate for 5 minutes
- Place tubes in centrifuge with all the lids of the 1.5 ml tubes facing the same direction and centrifuge at MAX speed for 1 minute
- Take tubes out - DO NOT pour off liquid, keep in tube
- Add an additional 50 ul of warmed 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 to each spin column by dripping directly over filter without touching it
 - *100 ul of DNA total*
 - *Only 25 ul of Tris added to KIC_6 for this elution*
- Incubate for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute
- Take out spin columns at discard
- Aliquot 6 ul of each sample to their respective PCR strip tube
  - 3 ul for agarose gel
  - 1 ul for Qubit
  - 1 ul for TapeStation (if needed)
  - 1 ul for error

*94 ul remaining in 1.5 ml sample tubes*

_Qubit dsDNA BR assay__

The captured pools were quantified following [Qubit protocol for BR DNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)

- 199 ul x 7.2 samples = 1432.8 ul of Buffer
- 1 ul x 7.2 samples = 7.2 ul of reagent

|Sample|Avg ng/Î¼l|
|----|----|
|Std 1|179 RFU|
|Std 2|18232 RFU|
|NAR_7|39.6|
|BAR_5|30.6|
|BAR_7|50.2|
|GHP_8|43.9|
|KIC_6|17.2|

__Agarose Gel Electrophoresis__

The DNA quality and size were assessed following [Agarose Gel Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-01/PPP-Lab-Gel-Protocol) for a small 1% gel.

- Only 3 ul of DNA for each sample were used
- Used a diluted gelgreen made by [Maggie Schedl](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/)

The samples still look a bit streaky, so I'll run them on a TapeStation.

__TapeStation__

Completed on January 20, 2021

Samples were run on the TapeStation following the protocol for [Genomic DNA](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/DNA-Tapestation/).

- Ran samples BAR_5 and KIC_6

See full report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lbIGKiY1sWVaq-7DMm4KU01Ii3Z0ce5h/view?usp=sharing).

KIC_6 looked really good, BAR_5 had a lot of smaller fragments around 1500 bp. Next time I will try smaller pieces of tissue.
